# noob-LESS-compiler

Something I gave shot as a final year undergrad project.
I'm ashamed of that version ( lol I'm not ). I've proudly buried it under the silly branch.

Yes, there was once a time when I had to push node_modules. 

> I've my reasons : the Wifi @ my institute was not quite good, and viva was supposed to be stressful ( which wasn't, and my noob attempt was lauded. Thankyou AS ! ðŸ˜Š )

This one would probably be a new version of my work.
Probably imbibes wisdom of learning of three years, and less horrible code.
